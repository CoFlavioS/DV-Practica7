# DV-Practica7

This practice is focused on learning about the A* algorithm for pathfinding and procedural generation of maps through the use of perlin noise.

On start it creates a maze where you can place the player with the first click and the goal with the second. Once both are placed the player will move towards the goal and regenerate the labirith after reaching it.
